				<ul> <strong>Health Insurance:</strong>
					<li>There are several types of health insurance in Denmark. Common to all of them is that they cover the customer's expenses for examination, treatment, rehabilitation, etc., and that the treatment takes place at private hospitals and by private practitioners and specialist doctors.</li>
					<li>In addition to operating expenses, this insurance also covers the client's expenses for physical therapy, chiropractic, psychological treatment, emergency medical assistance, treatment by specialist doctors, including psychiatrists, as well as the client's own costs for certain types of alternative treatment. </li>
					<li>The health insurance is primarily a part of your salary package or purchased through a spouse's connection to the private labor market. The insurance stops when you step out of the labor market.  The price of health insurance for people over 70 years is increasing and typically begins from around 4,500 kr.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul> <strong>Elderly:</strong>
					<li>The amount of the world’s population over 60 years will nearly be doubled within 2050 – from 12% to 22%. As such, the numbers of elderly who will need care increases and therefore we must find new ways to ensure that more elderly are healthy and self-reliant.</li>
					<li>Health and well-being are not necessarily synonyms. Most elderly have lost relations as they retired, friends and loved ones have passed away, and the children may live far away. Often the elderly is alone and it threatens their health. </li>
					<li>Still more of the elderly population are interested in using technologies that can help them in their everyday lives.</li>
